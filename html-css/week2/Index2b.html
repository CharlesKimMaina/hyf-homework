Online services such as amazon.com and buy.com among others have transformed
the way the transformed the shopping and bargaing hunting experience for

<h3>WEB DEVELOPMENT AS AN INDUSTRY</h3>
<p>Since the commercialisation of the web, web development has been a growing 
    industry. The growth of this industry is being driven by businesses wishing 
to use their website to sell products and services to customers.<br>

There is open source software for web development like BerkeleyDB, GlassFish, LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
stack and Perl/Plack. This has kept the cost of learning web development to a minimum. Another contributing 
factor to the growth of the industry has been the rise of easy-to-use WYSIWYG web-development software, such as 
Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and Microsoft Visual studio. Knowledge of HyperTextMarkup Language (HTML) or of 
programming languages is still required to use such software, but the basics can be learned and implemented 
quickly with the help files, technical books, internet tutorials, or face-to-face training. <br>

An ever-growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers build more dynamic and interactive websites.
Further, web developers now help to deliver applications as web services which were traditionally only available 
as applications on a desk-based computer. This has allowed for many opportunities to decentralize information and
media distribution. Examples can be seen with the rise of cloud services such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox 
and Google Docs. These web services allow users to interact with applications from many locations instead of 
being tied to a specific workstation for their application movement.</p>
